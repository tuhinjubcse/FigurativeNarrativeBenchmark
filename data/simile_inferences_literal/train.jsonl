Once the king of thieves had been slain, link refused to rest before heroically driving the savages back to the bridge of eldin for good. The shoddy collection of houses seem surreal to the princess, resting on the uneven town levels. The flicker of candlelight dances in nearby windows as zelda dips through the shadows, rounding corners and settling beside the old windmill overlooking the houses atop a small hill. A weak wind crawls through the mild night air, and the princess skates along the grass, silent as the wind itself, dropping into the deep well at the villages center.
