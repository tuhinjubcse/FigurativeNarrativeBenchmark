Rhys leaned back in his chair. She was like a kitten in a den of coyotes.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["\"What do you want to do first?\" he asked"]}
{"input": "That blush was what he was thinking about now, far more than the two meatwagons following him to the parking lot. He'd been observing isabella since he arrived in philadelphia over three days ago. Familiarizing himself with her routine, marking the places she visited... and watching robert \"robbery\" bertini as well. Robert was much less interesting a subject, in chance's opinion, and not just because isabella was infinitely more attractive. Robert was a typical schoolhouse bully, and all his clothes, money, houses or influence wouldn't change that. His insistence on marrying a woman who didn't want him was just like a child demanding a particular toy because some other child had it.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["Robert had a lot of money, and was a very wealthy man, but that didn't mean he"]}
{"input": "Let's get her! Bobby screamed. The giant let out a loud whoop of agreement. Apparently not. They rushed me at the same time, and bobby threw his elemental fire at me. He was strong in his magic but, compared to the blazing inferno that i'd faced when i'd killed mab, his power felt like a candle flame.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["I'd been able to block it, but it still hurt"]}
{"input": "My turn to scoff. \"really? Is that why captain stephenson did all the talking at the press conference outside the opera house? Is that why he stopped you from answering any questions? Is that why I'm being blamed for gordon giles's murder, even though we both know I was fishing myself out of the aneirin river when he was killed in that fake car accident? Face it, caine, the whole ashland police department is like a pair of three- week-old gym socks.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["It's not like the people who are supposed to be in charge of the investigation are any different,"]}
{"input": "He brought her hand up touched the gold ring on her right index finger the fair folk metal warm to the touch. \"clary,\" he said, \"you're clary. You're my best friend.\" Alec made his way up the hill to where magnus stood on the pathway overlooking the tent. He was leaning against a tree, hands in his pockets, and alec joined him to watch as simon, looking like a newborn duckling", "gold": [], "predictions": [", made his first steps towards the tent with his new parents"]}
{"input": "The voiles covering the french doors swayed a little, as the fierce winds found there way through minute cracks in the frame. I slipped into bed, forcing the childhood fear of a storm aside and pulled the sheets tightly around myself, banishing the cold. I screwed my eyes shut and waited until I fell into an uneasy sleep. A cloaked figure swept his way through the forest, deep into the parts where rogues ruled. Rogues like himself. He didn't make a sound as he walked, his movement like a falcon", "gold": [], "predictions": ["soaring through the air"]}
{"input": "The woman must have been very distraught after killing his cat. An honest mistake, no doubt. Because surely such an angel would never kill an innocent creature on purpose. He poked his head around the corner once again, but she'd disappeared. Confused, antonio slipped into the alley. His sensitive ears picked up every sound, but it was like a library on friday night", "gold": [], "predictions": [""]}
{"input": "He would reassure her that riora had agreed to him competing - and convince her that he could do this. He traced to london. To find the bed was empty and the chains broken. She was gone... when he traced directly to her, he appeared at the edge of a chamber of fire.

{"input": "Cabs came to a full stop in the midst of traffic so that the cabdrivers could scream at one another out their windows. This noise added to the already awesome din-ice cream peddlers shouting \"hokey-pokey, penny a lump,\" newspaper boys hawking the day's latest headline, and someone somewhere playing a barrel organ. Tessa wondered how everyone living and working in london wasn't deaf. As she stared out the window, an old woman carrying a large metal cage full of fluttering colorful birds stepped out alongside their coach. The old woman turned her head, and tessa saw that her skin was like a parrot's feathers", "gold": [], "predictions": [", and the old woman's eyes were like two burning stars"]}
{"input": "Maybe if he kept quiet, kyrian would only drain him. \"it's not what you think, nick.\". \"i think you're a bloodsucking demon vampire who's going to kill me-that's what I think.\" Before he could so much as blink, kyrian reached out and grabbed nick's neck with some kind of vulcan death grip.

{"input": "She was pissed that he couldn't spare a single call to his only child. Hey, pop, not only did I survive the florida training camp, I'm going to be an olympian! Thanks for calling in for an update. Fear, sadness, anger rinse and repeat.

{"input": "A column of light spilled out, framing the dark silhouette of a huge man. \"miss whelan?\" His voice was deep and gravelly. He moved to the edge of the light and became more visible.

{"input": "Pierce's expression didn't shift as he sat like a stone across from vivian. \"it would be wise for you to walk away, witch,\" he said, his words slow as he chose them carefully to try to sound like everyone else. \"you will be beaten soundly.\" Vivian looked at him curiously, but seemed utterly unworried. \"not even a circle stops a bullet at this range,\" she said confidently as she tugged a phone from an inner pocket and flipped it open. God, the thing was like a credit card.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["she'd never seen anything like it—it was a small rectangle with a large screen on the front"]}
{"input": "The corner where the north and west walls met was hard and unpromising, and for a moment ezio clung there, frozen, looking for a handhold that didn't seem to exist. He looked down, and saw far beneath him one of the guards on the battlements looking up. He could see the pale face clearly. He could see the man's eyes. He pressed himself to the wall. In his dark clothing he'd be like a cockroach on a white tablecloth.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["He could hear the man, the guard"]}
{"input": "Shumenko was working in the fermentation room when arkadin found him. He was a reed-thin man, much younger than arkadin had imagined-no more than thirty or so. He had thick hair the color of goldenrod that stood up from his scalp like a series of cockscombs. Music spilled out from a portable player-a british band, the cure. Arkadin had heard the song many times in moscow clubs, but it seemed startling here in the hind end of the crimea. Shumenko stood on a catwalk four yards in the air, bent over a stainless-steel apparatus like a blue whale.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["His long fingers, his thick hands, were covered with a thick layer of grease and oil"]}
{"input": "As they rattled along at a breathtaking pace she looked over at amun, whose face was grim and tight as a fist. But what was he leading her to? Surely if al mokhabarat was involved, he wouldn't allow her even the faintest glimmering of the truth. Were they on a wild goose chase? 'we 'll find them, amun,\" she said, more to alleviate the tension than because of any strong conviction. His laugh was like a jackal's bark.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["\"we'm on a good goose chase, and we'll find them"]}
{"input": "We wanted to know who you intend to send after jason bourne now that harun... his voice trailed off. Icoupov had been contemplating the same question. He'd made a mental list that included any number of people he could send, but he kept eliminating most of them, for one reason or another. But on the second and third run through he began to realize that these reasons were in one way or another trivial. Now, as ismail asked the question again, he knew. The weater in alter botanischer garten was like rain forest.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["There was no way he could get there"]}
{"input": "Sounding like a guy on adam 12 makes mike uncomfortable, but under the circumstances, \"partner\" is the right word. Linoge steps out, still awkwardly bent over but graceful. And still smiling that faint, corners-of-the-mouth smile. Hatch takes a step back to give him room as linoge mounts the steps. Their prisoner is cuffed and they have the guns, but hatch is still scared of linoge. Linoge stands in the driving snow, like a man in his own living room.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["He's not afraid of anything, but he's afraid of lina and he's terrified of being"]}
{"input": "The ground tilted and flashed past below. Reacher saw the mountain hairpins unwinding and the parade ground sliding past. The knot of tiny people was breaking up. They were drifting away into the trees and being swallowed up under the green canopy. Then the narrow slash of the rifle range was under them, then the broad stony circle of the bastion. Then the aircraft rose sharply as the ground fell away so that the big white courthouse slipped by underneath like a dollhouse.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["Reacher was not sure what to do"]}
{"input": "She slipped two fingers under the curtain covering the narrow side-window and pulled the fabric back a half an inch. A woman twirled near the hedge. Her head whipped from side to side as she looked for a way into the house. Her white slacks fit like a second skin, and her chiffon blouse crisscrossed over an impressive chest. A butter colored belt draped over her slim hips. Her  sandals had crepe-thin soles and heels like a wedding cake.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["She had a long, dark, curly black-blond hair"]}
{"input": "I brightened at the thought that the sydney goons were looking quite different now. \"come in gentlemen, come in,\" tarasoff welcomed us, as if we were here by his express invitation. He ignored the fact that steve was already halfway to his desk.

{"input": "He studied her expression for a moment, trying to read her, but soon gave up. He turned his attention back to the tunnel walls. His biggest concern was that they might have forgotten to mark a passage somewhere. After all theyd been through, he didnt want to wind up getting lost now, but luck was currently with them. Soon they found the rusty ladder that would take them back up into the service tunnels below the campus. Neither of them ever imagined that they would  see streetlights from the dark side of a sewer grate, but there it was, like a lighthouse beacon to a fogged-in vessel.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["They climbed the ladder, and the light revealed a long hallway with a long, dark corridor ahead"]}
{"input": "I gulped and felt the hair on my arms stand. In the chilly morning breeze, I perspired. Moviei watched a movie the other day where a character said exactly that, I said, already afraid. John grinned as he took out another cigarette and lit it, his mouth widened in an attempt to smile. Then, he raised his left hand and began removing his cap. I held my breath, waiting for what my gaze would fall upon, and I almost shrieked as I stared at his headbald like a lamp post.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["His eyes were black, but the whites were a deep blue, and his nose was a little too"]}
{"input": "I figured that the whole operation would take between four and five hours. I decided that a sunday night would be the best time to pull the hit. If you ever happened to be wandering about the city on a late sunday night, then you know how abandoned the streets are. Consider this city life ticks to a metropolitan internal clock mondays through thursdays, there is always moderate graveyard traffic. Fridays and saturdays, unless there is a blizzard, the nightlife is just as busy, if not more so than daylight hours. But sundays, around midnight, leading into the 9-5 workweek, the streets are like an alcoholics liquor cabinet.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["As the sun set, I started my search"]}
{"input": "Even if it looks like hes leaving, ill bet you hes hiding around the corner, just to catch you sneaking back! The poor man was having kittens. He was so worried he'd led you guys into a relationship you werent ready for! With the odd, slight fluttering of her wings, jial glided along just a few inches above the floor. As usual, she was shoeless, wearing only her intensely white bobby socks. Now and again, as other people walked by, she passed through them as if she were like a mirage.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["She was always a few steps ahead of them, and never caught"]}
{"input": "He yelled and bolted down the ramp, his fellow agents, cops, and guards from the boys protection detail following close behind. Ames stop, or well take you down!

{"input": "Listen to me boy, these things arent like any of those science fiction movie type living dead creatures, no these are much freaking worse. Think of them as wild predators that walk upright, have opposable thumbs and have the brain capacity to do only one thing, hunt. They dont bite you and turn you, they rip the flesh from your bones while you still alive. They hunt in small packs each with a leader, their ways similar to that of wild dogs. Thankfully all wev'e had to deal with is the occasional stray, like our friend over there.

{"input": "Just running my hands up my own, wonderfully long neck is a priceless sensation in its own right. How many times has this neck been kissed, stroked, envied? I mean, I know but I just cant't't count the number of times! I catch a view of myself in one of the shops many mirrors and my eyes blaze with satisfaction. God, I'm beautiful even with all these freaks still clambering over my back, stitching me up with all that snake-like twine theyd used in my operation, I look like a vogue model.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["I think I'm going to have to get a new outfit for the party"]}
{"input": "What do you want? I mutter, hoping he wouldn't stab me or something. I turn around and look up at him. He is about six feet tall, very big, and wearing a very heavy jacket that you could probably stay warm in ice cold water in. His beard is long, down to his chest, and he has a pony tail that was a long braid that grew to his back. His skin is unlike mine, I am like a polar bear.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["He has a long, black, pointed nose and a long black mustache that goes down to the end"]}
{"input": "Mr smithe-williams or call me teddy as he lasciviously whispered in her ear, was a keen student of architecture, although to be specific, call me teddys only interest was in structures of a female kind. He spent more time smiling and winking at blushing, respectable young ladies, than he did marveling at the genius of wren. Several times during the day, francis had fought off the compulsion to suddenly break into a run and leave them all behind. But the current ladies fashion of crinolines made this somewhat impossible. Now she resigned herself to the fact that there was no escape and she sat down on one of the side pews, leaving her giddy sisters to escort teddy around.

Yet, at his steady gaze, all such thoughts fled her mind, and only one remained. I love you.

{"input": "His wife was dying. The nurse hadn't said as much, but levana knew it was true. It was clear that evret had been hurried here because it would be his only chance to say good-bye, just as it was clear that it wasn't a complete surprise to him.
