Since nine thirty she's been trying to tell everyone about count saint-germain's secret society and how there are time travelers living among us. We did all we could to make her go home, but she's like an eel", "gold": [], "predictions": ["She was in a state of confusion."]}
{"narrative": "It was a strange device made of polished wood and metal with any amount of knobs, flaps, and little wheels. All the surfaces were painted with miniature pictures of the sun, moon, and stars, and inscribed with mysterious signs and patterns. It was curved like a violin case and set with sparkling jewels, great big ones that couldn't possibly be real. \"is that the chronograph? It's so small!\" \"it weighs nine pounds,\" said dr. white, sounding like a father telling you the weight of his newborn baby.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["It was very beautiful and very complicated looking."]}
{"narrative": "I'm just getting word that mr. and mrs. clark have been looking for her for months to no avail. It's heartbreaking that their long search for their daughter had to end in such tragedy.\" Another image appeared on the screen. It was a picture of tabitha in a cheerleading uniform, surrounded by girls aria had never seen before. Then, there was a photo of tabitha standing in front of a stadium, wearing an oversized new jersey devils t-shirt and giving a thumbs-up. Ali never would have worn something like a new jersey devils t-shirt.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["The last image was of her wearing a jersey that had a devils logo on it."]}
{"narrative": "She heard a slight rustle, as everyone turned to stare at her; she felt the heat of all those eyes on her skin. The air was leaden, totally still. Heather fumbled in her pocket for the key to the padlock. Nat's breathing was rapid and shallow, like an injured animal's. For a second, heather couldn't feel the key and didn't know whether to be relieved; then her fingers closed around metal. In the silence and the stillness, the click of the padlock seemed like a rifle report.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["The room was silent as everyone waited for her to begin."]}
{"narrative": "A tinted window between the front and back of the cab shielded our view of the driver. I couldn't even see a silhouette. The car could've been remote controlled for all we knew. We wound through the streets, taking corners just slow enough not to screech. The driver didn't need to try so hard to disorient us, if that was his intention. We were in london, where the street system was like a bowl of spaghetti.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["The streets were made of twisty little passages."]}
{"narrative": "I have often wondered.\" \"doing it isn't the same as reading a book about it,\" I shot back. \"the only thing the same as reading a book is... reading a book!\" She laughed. \"if you'd chosen books instead, you'd still have a finger.\" Like her mother, she had abram von helrung's eyes, like a mountain lake on a sunny autumn day.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["I had no idea what to say to that. I didn't know whether to be angry or hurt"]}
{"narrative": "The worst he can say is no... and then I can go back to loitering. I inhale then let out the deep breath i've been holding and take in the scent of cornbread, fresh laundry, dirt, cedar trees, and of course, horseshit. I can do this. I charge down the driveway and suddenly a wailing, high-pitched alarm goes off. My first thought is: tornado! But the skies are like a robin's egg.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["My first thought was that I'd been caught."]}
{"narrative": "In fact, I couldn't even summon her to go-i had to threaten her with you.\" He let out a breath of frustration. \"the underworld has weakened her, though.\" An evil smile crept across his face. \"it has tainted her, which makes things easier for me. Getting her to come here was like a master whistling to call his dog. \"", "gold": [], "predictions": ["He was simply too charming."]}
{"narrative": "They emerged from the darkness of a passageway into the open air of one of the main decks-a wide semicircle of rough timber planks. The school had floated quite high since captain niall had jumped them on board. It no longer bobbed through the low mists of the moor, but was instead well above them. Below now lay a mass of white cloud tops, and above was the starry night. Sophronia had never thought to see the other side of clouds. They looked like a feather mattress.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["The cloud tops looked like a feather mattress."]}
{"narrative": "It was nothing more than the equivalent of opting out of a popular club. To me, however, my actions had much more significant't't consequences, ripples that I could see washing away bits and pieces of my future. All day, I watched the clock anxiously. I wanted the day to be over, but I was also curious to see bo in chemistry, to see what his reaction would be to what happened. When the bell rang to let out fifth period, I dashed out the door and down the hall to get to mr. dole's class. Despite all the other turmoil in my life, just the thought of seeing bo made me like a caffeine junkie.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["he wanted to see him, but at the same time he was fearful of what he would say."]}
{"narrative": "She rarely attracted attention, apart from the rude stares at her leg. In fact, people often ran into or brushed past her as if she were invisible, making far too much body contact. This was likely because of her appearance. The polite would have termed her figure rubenesque, if they could have found it under her oversized clothes. To modern eyes she was overweight, her extra pounds compounded by baggy garments and well-worn sneakers that added little to her five-foot-seven height. Her hair was almost like a raven's wing", "gold": [], "predictions": ["Her hair was dark and her eyes were a deep green."]}
{"narrative": "Rhys smiled benignly, curious to see if she would pull the same stunt twice. Megan hesitated a moment, and then, with a murmured, \"thank you,\" she picked up his glass and took a sip. She wasn't much of a wine connoisseur, but she thought she tasted a hint of cherries and cinnamon. At his signal, the waitress arrived with a fresh tablecloth and another glass of pinot noir. Rhys leaned back in his chair. She was like a kitten in a den of coyotes.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["This was a dangerous situation for her."]}
{"narrative": "With a slight shake, bones leapt down from his perch and headed to the rear of the car. \"we're nearly at the place, and there's still work to be done. Hold open that bag for me, kitten.\" His normal jaunty tone was back. Perplexed by the earlier moment, I joined him at the rear of the trailer. Bones unwrapped sergio from his plastic shroud like a child ripping through wrapping paper on christmas.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["He was excited to get on with the task."]}
{"narrative": "That blush was what he was thinking about now, far more than the two meatwagons following him to the parking lot. He'd been observing isabella since he arrived in philadelphia over three days ago. Familiarizing himself with her routine, marking the places she visited... and watching robert \"robbery\" bertini as well. Robert was much less interesting a subject, in chance's opinion, and not just because isabella was infinitely more attractive. Robert was a typical schoolhouse bully, and all his clothes, money, houses or influence wouldn't change that. His insistence on marrying a woman who didn't want him was just like a child demanding a particular toy because some other child had it.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["Chance was observing the woman as she got into her car."]}
{"narrative": "Bones took in a long breath, making me wonder if the air was also tinged with my arousal. Probably. Scent was a more obvious indicator of desire for vampires than a man with a hard-on tenting his pants was for humans. \"right,\" he said, the single word edged with a hint of roughness. Then he folded his aura in, the invisible energy around him decreasing until only the faint tingles of an average vampire remained. At the same time, my link to his emotions ceased, like a cell phone dropping a call.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["He was so potent I could feel him all around me."]}
{"narrative": "Let's get her! Bobby screamed. The giant let out a loud whoop of agreement. Apparently not. They rushed me at the same time, and bobby threw his elemental fire at me. He was strong in his magic but, compared to the blazing inferno that i'd faced when i'd killed mab, his power felt like a candle flame.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["As I have said, he was strong in his magic but weak in his power."]}
{"narrative": "You saw what I did to one of your fellow elders back at the shade, didn't you? Leave my wife now, lest the same fate befall you. Sofia's eyes rolled and she began to laugh. \"as if you would risk your precious lover's life! Remember that your corrine is not here to save the day this time. She's   like a bee out of sting.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["She was buzzing around me, trying to distract me."]}
{"narrative": "He brought her hand up touched the gold ring on her right index finger the fair folk metal warm to the touch. \"clary,\" he said, \"you're clary. You're my best friend.\" Alec made his way up the hill to where magnus stood on the pathway overlooking the tent. He was leaning against a tree, hands in his pockets, and alec joined him to watch as simon, looking like a newborn duckling", "gold": [], "predictions": ["Just a few feet away, simon was sitting on the grass, looking as out of place as"]}
{"narrative": "The voiles covering the french doors swayed a little, as the fierce winds found there way through minute cracks in the frame. I slipped into bed, forcing the childhood fear of a storm aside and pulled the sheets tightly around myself, banishing the cold. I screwed my eyes shut and waited until I fell into an uneasy sleep. A cloaked figure swept his way through the forest, deep into the parts where rogues ruled. Rogues like himself. He didn't make a sound as he walked, his movement like a falcon", "gold": [], "predictions": ["The rogue walked swiftly and silently."]}
{"narrative": "It's a slow, bumbling turn. Out of the corner of my eye, I see vlad nod over our heads. We turn right into the twin chests of devon and ashley. I try to move us to the side, but lindsay's legs are tangled up with mine, causing me to step on one of their toes. I make the mistake of looking up at their faces. They don't smirk, they don't glower, and in the second before I veer my gaze away, their eyes are like a flat-lining heart patient.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["There was no emotion in their faces at all."]}
{"narrative": "The woman must have been very distraught after killing his cat. An honest mistake, no doubt. Because surely such an angel would never kill an innocent creature on purpose. He poked his head around the corner once again, but she'd disappeared. Confused, antonio slipped into the alley. His sensitive ears picked up every sound, but it was like a library on friday night", "gold": [], "predictions": ["It was so quiet that he could hear his own heart beat."]}
{"narrative": "He would reassure her that riora had agreed to him competing - and convince her that he could do this. He traced to london. To find the bed was empty and the chains broken. She was gone... when he traced directly to her, he appeared at the edge of a chamber of fire. The cavern that housed it was like an auditorium", "gold": [], "predictions": ["He appeared on the stage in a huge cavern."]}
{"narrative": "Cabs came to a full stop in the midst of traffic so that the cabdrivers could scream at one another out their windows. This noise added to the already awesome din-ice cream peddlers shouting \"hokey-pokey, penny a lump,\" newspaper boys hawking the day's latest headline, and someone somewhere playing a barrel organ. Tessa wondered how everyone living and working in london wasn't deaf. As she stared out the window, an old woman carrying a large metal cage full of fluttering colorful birds stepped out alongside their coach. The old woman turned her head, and tessa saw that her skin was like a parrot's feathers", "gold": [], "predictions": ["Her face was so wrinkled and yet her eyes were so bright."]}
{"narrative": "Jace, he knew, didn't feel that way. Simon had watched with a sick feeling in his stomach, unable to look away, as jace had taken clary in his arms and kissed her with such force simon had thought one or the both of them might shatter. He'd held her as if he wanted to crush her into himself, as if he could fold the two of them into one person. Of course clary was strong, stronger than simon gave her credit for. She was a shadowhunter, with all that entailed. But that didn't matter because what they had between them was still like a flickering candle flame", "gold": [], "predictions": ["Jace and Clary had a very passionate relationship."]}
{"narrative": "Maybe if he kept quiet, kyrian would only drain him. \"it's not what you think, nick.\". \"i think you're a bloodsucking demon vampire who's going to kill me-that's what I think.\" Before he could so much as blink, kyrian reached out and grabbed nick's neck with some kind of vulcan death grip. He wanted to fight, but he was like a pup being held by the scruff.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["He tried to fight, but Kyrian had a strong grip on him."]}
{"narrative": "Most of all, I wish you luck \"everything changes today.\" Unable to believe he'd lived long enough to see this undeserved dream, jess brady stood outside the church in his best, itchiest clothes. This was the last turn he'd ever expected for his miserable life. He'd been robbing banks and staring down experienced men in a gunfight without flinching or breaking a sweat since he was thirteen years old. Yet here, right now, he was like a one-eyed buck in a barn fire.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["He looked so nervous that I was afraid he might faint."]}
{"narrative": "A column of light spilled out, framing the dark silhouette of a huge man. \"miss whelan?\" His voice was deep and gravelly. He moved to the edge of the light and became more visible. Yes another security guard, caitlyn assumed, since he was well over six feet tall and looked like an army tank.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["He had a barrel chest and thick legs."]}
{"narrative": "Sean's lip curled. \"i've turned down your invitations three times, brandon. I've run out of courtesy.\" The man pushed past her and walked down the street in such a hurry that he almost knocked over a trash can. Rue swung around to watch him go, her stance belligerent. She might look ruthless to the human eye, but sean could tell she was full of shame at being so stern with a man like a persistent puppy.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["She was quite the opposite of a vicious killer."]}
{"narrative": "The corner where the north and west walls met was hard and unpromising, and for a moment ezio clung there, frozen, looking for a handhold that didn't seem to exist. He looked down, and saw far beneath him one of the guards on the battlements looking up. He could see the pale face clearly. He could see the man's eyes. He pressed himself to the wall. In his dark clothing he'd be like a cockroach on a white tablecloth.", "gold": [], "predictions": ["His eyes seemed to be everywhere at once."]}
